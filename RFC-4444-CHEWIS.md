# RFC: Digital Implementation of the Chewy Decimal System (CDS)

## Status
DRAFT

## Abstract
This RFC proposes a standardized digital implementation of the Chewy Decimal System[[1]](https://chewydecimalsystem.org/) (CDS), a classification system inspired by the Dewey Decimal Classification [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) but specifically designed for organizing grocery store products and aisles in a systematic, intuitive manner.

In the Chewy Decimal system each major category of Grocery item has a hundreds number (Ex: 000-099: Fresh Produce ) with items in the tens for sub-catagories (110 : Rice ), and specific numbers for more specieic catagories (114: Jasmine Rice). Like the Dewy Decimal system, sub-numbers can be defined and added for more specificity (for example 114.53 : Jasmine Rice : Tea-washed, 3lb bag). 

## Problem Statement
Current grocery store layouts often lack standardization and intuitive organization, leading to:
- Inefficient shopping experiences
- Difficulty in finding specific items
- Inconsistent product placement across different stores
- Challenges in implementing digital shopping assistants
- Time wasted searching for products

## Proposed Solution
Implement a digital version of the Chewy Decimal System that assigns unique numerical identifiers, a-la Dewy Decimal System or Library of Congress catagorization. This will include the overall identification system, as well as grass-roots / community contributed efforts to map unruly stores, and encourage ruly stores to adopt the system.   

1. Provides a standardized catagorization system 
3. Provides a standardized API for digital integration
4. Enables efficient product location and inventory management
5. Enable localization and internalional cooperation based on a worldwide open standard. 

## Detailed Design
Main catagories of food are outlined here, details of assignemnt below this level is handed by a committee, and is subject to an update at must once a year. Chewy-YY (where YY is a year) refers to a speficic chewy scheme as appprovied in that year.  The goal of Chewy is to be stable enough to never / almost never need to specify a year revision number.  

### 2. Main Categories (Level 1)
- 000-099: Fresh Produce
- 100-199: Meat and Seafood
- 200-299: Dairy and Eggs
- 300-399: Bakery
- 400-499: Pantry Staples
- 500-599: Frozen Foods
- 600-699: Beverages
- 700-799: Snacks and Confectionery
- 800-899: Household and Personal Care
- 900-999: Specialty Items

#### Special Cases 600 - 699:
The Frozen section is a prefix for existing food catagories. For ex



## Risks and Mitigations

### 1. Adoption Resistance
**Risk**: Stores may resist implementing a new classification system
**Mitigation**: 
- Provide DIY methods to track your own store and stores you visit catagorization. 
- Provide clear implementation guidelines
- Make it fun.
- Don't actually expect anyone to adpot this ever. 


### 2. System Complexity
**Risk**: Simple classification system may encourage people to make it more complex.
**Mitigation**:
- Provide automated classification tools
- Implement validation systems
- Create comprehensive documentation

### 3. Data Migration
**Risk**: Difficulty in migrating existing systems
**Mitigation**:
- Develop migration utilities
- Provide legacy system support
- Offer professional services support

## Timeline
- Planning and Design: 2 days
- Development: 4 months
- Testing and Validation: 2 months
- Initial Rollout: 2 months
- Full Implementation: 6 months

## Success Metrics
1. Reduction in customer search time
2. Increase in digital shopping adoption
3. Improvement in inventory management efficiency
4. Reduction in restocking errors
5. Increased customer satisfaction scores
