# RFC: Digital Implementation of the Chewy Decimal System (CDS)

## Status
DRAFT

## Abstract
This RFC proposes a standardized digital implementation of the Chewy Decimal System[[1]](https://chewydecimalsystem.org/) (CDS), a classification system inspired by the Dewey Decimal Classification [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) but specifically designed for organizing grocery store products and aisles in a systematic, intuitive manner.

This document is inspired by the specification of the WHOIS protocol
 
## Problem Statement
Current grocery store layouts often lack standardization and intuitive organization, leading to:
- Inefficient shopping experiences
- Difficulty in finding specific items
- Inconsistent product placement across different stores
- Challenges in implementing digital shopping assistants
- Time wasted searching for products

## Proposed Solution
Implement a digital version of the Chewy Decimal System that:
1. Assigns unique numerical identifiers to every:
   - Main category
   - Product Category 
   - Product Sub-Category
   - Product Sub-Sub-Category
   - Individual product

2. Creates a hierarchical structure similar to the Dewey Decimal System but optimized for grocery stores
3. Provides a standardized API for digital integration
4. Enables efficient product location and inventory management
5. Enable localization and internalional cooperation based on a worldwide open standard. 

## Detailed Design
Main catagories are outlined here, details below that level are ad

### 2. Main Categories (Level 1)
- 000-099: Fresh Produce
- 100-199: Meat and Seafood
- 200-299: Dairy and Eggs
- 300-399: Bakery
- 400-499: Pantry Staples
- 500-599: Frozen Foods
- 600-699: Beverages
- 700-799: Snacks and Confectionery
- 800-899: Household and Personal Care
- 900-999: Specialty Items
